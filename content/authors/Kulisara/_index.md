I am Dr. Kulisara Marupanthorn, a veterinarian and scientist specializing in stem cell research. I hold a Ph.D. in Medical Science with a focus on Cell and Molecular Biology (Stem cells) and have an extensive publication record in this field.

Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor at Chiang Mai Rajabhat University. In this role, I share my expertise with students and conduct research on various topics related to animal health. My particular interest lies in the use of stem cells and medicinal plants to enhance animal health and welfare.

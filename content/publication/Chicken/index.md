abstract: The goal of this work was to comparative study of the production efficiency and morphology of Maehongson chickens at various ages versus Praduhangdum, male layer chickens and broiler. Completely randomized design (CRD) experiments were devised using one-day-old broilers, 150 of each breed for a total of 600. According to the breed of chickens, the experiment was divided into four groups, with each group containing 10 replications and 15 repetitions. Each group of chickens was fed the same feed. The experiment was supplied with ad libitum water and feed. The body weight and feed intake of those chickens were recorded. The chickens' morphology was measured. Measure and document the morphological characteristics of Maehongson chickens by gender segregation. Praduhangdum and broiler at 5-8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks, 3 per sex, were repeated six times for a total of 6 per rep, and data on the crowing frequency of 16-week-old Maehongson chickens was collected. The results revealed that broilers had a greater ADG (32.53±2.10g) than Praduhangdum (17.76±0.70g), male layer chickens (9.79±0.63g), and Maehongson chickens (8.52±0.39g) (P<0.001). The 5-week-old broiler had the highest ADG based on statistical significance (P<0.001). At 16 weeks of age, Praduhangdum had average growth rates not different from those of Maehongson chickens (P<0.001), but greater than male layer chickens (P < 0.001). Broilers aged 0-5 weeks consumed the most food (P < 0.001), but the feed conversion ratio of 0–5-week-old broilers (1.37±0.14) was favorable than that of other chickens (P<0.001). Maehongson chickens aged 0-16 weeks had the same FCR as male layer chickens but were inferior to Praduhangdum (P<0.001). According to morphological studies, female Maehongson chickens aged 5 and 16 weeks had the least less body width (P<0.001).

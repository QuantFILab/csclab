abstract: This study aims to propose the confidence intervals of the location parameter and the scale parameter for the two-parameter exponential distribution based on double Type II censored data which is the confidence intervals that use Jackknife method to adjust the confidence intervals of Fauzy (2004). Coverage probability and interval width are criteria to compare the efficiency of the confidence intervals. The results of simulation study show that proposed confidence interval is better than Faucy’s confidence interval for the scale parameter. For the location parameter, these two confidence intervals perform poorly in term of the coverage probability which is lower to nominal level. In the results of real data sets show that the proposed confidence intervals have shorter interval width than Faucy’s confidence intervals for the location parameter and the scale parameter.
